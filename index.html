            <h1>Economy</h1>
            <p>
              Economic growth is measured by an increase in gross domestic
              product (GDP), which is defined as the combined value of all goods
              and services produced within a country in a year. ... A company
              that buys a new manufacturing plant or invests in new technologies
              creates jobs, spending, which leads to growth in the economy.

            <h1>Technology</h1>
            <p>
              Technological advancement and economic growth are truly related to
              each other. The level of technology is also an important
              determinant of economic growth. The rapid rate of growth can be
              achieved through high level of technology. ... Thus, it is the
              technological progress which keeps the economy moving.

            <h1>Infrastructure</h1>
            <p>
              infrastructure spending creates jobs as workers must be hired to
              complete the green-lighted projects. It is also capable of
              spawning new economic growth. For example, the construction of a
              new highway might lead to other investments such as gas stations
              and retail stores opening to cater to motorists.

            <h1>Demand</h1>
            <p>
              Demand-led growth is the foundation of an economic theory claiming
              that an increase in aggregate demand will ultimately cause an
              increase in total output in the long run. This is based on a
              hypothetical sequence of events where an increase in demand will,
              in effect, stimulate an increase in supply (within resource
              limitations). This stands in opposition to the common
              neo-classical theory that demand follows supply, and consequently,
              that supply determines growth in the long run.

            <h1>Democracy</h1>
            <p>
              India today has the proud distinction of being the world’s largest
              democracy. A remarkable Constitution, well-developed democratic
              institutions and true participation by the people in social
              governance are the hallmarks of this democracy. Faith in the
              democratic process is nurtured as well as protected by an
              independent judiciary, an alert and free media and active
              non-governmental organisations. The symbols of a vibrant democracy
              are all around us.
